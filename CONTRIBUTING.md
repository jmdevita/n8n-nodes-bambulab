## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Define types for all function parameters and return values
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for complex object structures

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: camelCase for TypeScript files (e.g., `MqttHelper.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `BambuLabMqttClient`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `publishCommand`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`)
- **Interfaces/Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `PrinterStatus`)

### Code Style

- Use tabs for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

The project uses Prettier and ESLint for code formatting. Run `npm run lintfix` to auto-fix style issues.

### Error Handling

- Use `NodeOperationError` for n8n-related errors
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include context in error messages (e.g., which operation failed)
- Clean up resources (close connections) in `finally` blocks

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all helper functions
- Test error cases, not just happy paths
- Use descriptive test names: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Aim for high test coverage

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Operation

1. **Update types** in `helpers/types.ts` if needed
2. **Add command builder** in `helpers/commands.ts`
3. **Add operation to node description** in `BambuLab.node.ts`:
   - Add to the resource's operation options
   - Add any required parameters
   - Implement in the execute method
4. **Write tests** for the new functionality
5. **Update README** with the new operation
6. **Add example workflow** if applicable

### Adding a New Resource

1. **Define types** for the resource in `helpers/types.ts`
2. **Create helper module** if complex logic is needed
3. **Add resource to node description** in `BambuLab.node.ts`
4. **Define operations** for the resource
5. **Implement operations** in execute method
6. **Write comprehensive tests**
7. **Update documentation**

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to the code they test. Use Jest for testing.

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something when condition is met', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test';

    // Act
    const result = functionToTest(input);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected');
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Include code examples for complex features
- Keep examples up to date

## Release Process

(Maintainers only)

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit changes: `git commit -am "Release vX.Y.Z"`
4. Create tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
5. Push: `git push && git push --tags`
6. GitHub Actions will publish to npm
